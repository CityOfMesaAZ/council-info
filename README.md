Council Info
============

This repo holds structured data about people and was developed to support the needs of
the [MuniciPal](https://github.com/codeforamerica/MuniciPal) project. 

In the future, developers could use data from the [Open Civic Data](http://opencivicdata.org/) project, 
or an similar service provided by a city's own API.

## Using this project

`people.js` contains info about councilmembers (plus the mayor and city manager) and links to photos of those people. 

You can edit that file, or if you are starting from scratch you can recreate the file using [this little tool](bit.ly/mesacouncileditor2).

We use the `img/` directory as a place to hold the images that are mentioned in `people.js`, 
but you could just as easily use an external service like imgur.com.

Note that we're using gh-pages to serve people.js so the correct headers are set.
